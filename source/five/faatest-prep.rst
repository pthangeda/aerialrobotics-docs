   FAA guidelines keep changing and the latest guidelines can be found `here <https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/become_a_drone_pilot/>`_. The author is not liable for any errors in this guide. This is not an official preparation guide. You can find the FAA recommended reading material `at this link <https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/remote_pilot_study_guide.pdf>`_.

Introduction
============

What is Part-107 Small UAS Rule?
*********************************
`FAA <https://www.faa.gov/>`_ `Part-107 <https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/part_107/>`_ is the section of latest Federal Aviation Regulations which contains the rules for operations of non-hobbyist small unmanned aerial systems which weigh less than 55 pounds. It broadly lists the
operating requirements, the pilot certification, the UAS certification and privacy issues related to UAS operations. Flying unmanned aerial systems for **research and educational purposes comes under Part-107 regulations** and hence requires us to have a Remote Pilot Certification before flying outdoors.

What are the requirements to fly under Small UAS Rule?
******************************************************
Before flying under the FAA's Small UAS Rule, every individual must:

* Obtain a `Remote Pilot Certificate <https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/part_107/remote_pilot_cert/>`_ from the FAA
* Register the UAS with FAA under Part-107
* Follow all Part-107 `rules    <https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/part_107/#or>`_

Registering UAS is a straight forward process and can be done `online <https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/registration/>`_. We discuss about Remote Pilot Certification in the next section.

How to get a Remote Pilot Certificate?
***************************************
To obtain a Remote Pilot Airman Certification, an individual must:

* Be atleast 16 years old
* Pass an aeronautical knowledge test
* Undergo `TSA <https://www.tsa.gov/>`_ security screening

The rest of the guide discusses the details of the aeronautical knowledge test and provides relevant material for test preparation.

.. note::
   A person who already holds a pilot certificate issued under 14 CFR part 61 and has successfully completed a flight review within the previous 24 months **does not** have to take the aeronautical knowledge test and can complete a part 107 online training course at `www.faasafety.gov <www.faasafety.gov>`_ to satisfy this requirement.


Steps in Obtaining Remote Pilot Certification
**********************************************

* Prepare for the aeronautical knowledge test using the resources provided in this guide or through other resources available online.

* Book an appointment at nearest FAA authorized knowledge center by calling PSI Services LLC at 1-800-211-2753 or 1-800-947-4228 and mentioning the code of the closest center (Site Code: LAS61801 - Parkland College for UIUC students). You'll be charged 150$ for this.

* Carry valid ID that contains photo, date of birth, signature, and physical or residential address. Non-US citizens will need to present their passport AND another government-issued ID.

* Further details about the things to do/take on test data and location of the Parkland test center are available `here <https://aviation.parkland.edu/APPLY/FAA-Testing>`_.

* If you pass the test, collect your test ID which will be the only proof that you have taken the test.

* If you fail the test, you may retake the exam by repeating the entire registration process, paying the full exam fee, and rescheduling an appointment.

* Passing the test only validates your knowledge. The actual application for license should be submitted through `IACRA <https://iacra.faa.gov/IACRA>`_ by registering and then logging in, selecting "Start New Application" with Application Type "Pilot", Certifications "Remote Pilot". Enter your test ID when asked for and finish the application.

* After you pass required background checks, temporary printable certificate will be available through your IACRA account. Official certificate/card will be mailed to your address and could take as long as three months.

* The license is valid for 2 years. Please check the airzone restrictions before flying by using the FAA B4UFLY app or the Airmap app and apply for (near) real-time authorization through LAANC if required.
